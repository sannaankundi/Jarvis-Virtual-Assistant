 You know what this is, a VA.

# Not a pro explanation:

- When you run it, it listens to you.
- You can ask it to start giving you latest News(API).
- You can ask it to play some music(you have to have a selected list of the music).
- If you have the, uh *scratches head*, Open AI API, you can also integrate that and get real-time all-rounded replies to whatever you ask.
- The voice is adjustable whether you want female or male. It was female on default... but I changed that. I don't think if there are other voices as well. E.g. multiple female, etc.
